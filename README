Note: this release is published as a beta, as it contains no tests
      so far. Nevertheless, it is considered stable as it was used
      in several larger projects.


INTRO

Welcome!

This is the C<PerlPoint::Template::Traditional> package,
which allows to use an extended version of the traditional
C<pp2html> template language with PerlPoints C<pp2tdo>
generators.

Please see the POD documentation of the module for all the
features provided.

The traditional template allows to write PerlPoint styles
quickly for people familiar with the traditional syntax.
People used to run other template engines can use them,
too, given an engine is available. Please search CPAN
or the project page for C<PerlPoint::Template::...> modules.

As a user of a style that is based on this engine, all you
have to do is to install this package.


INSTALLATION

As a prerequisite, install C<PerlPoint::Package> with the
main template layer C<PerlPoint::Template>. Then follow
the usual steps to install a distribution:

  unpack
  make test install distclean

or use C<cpanp> or C<cpan> to get all prerequisites automatically.



DOCUMENTATION

Please refer to the POD documentation of the installed modules,
and to the tutorial that comes with C<PerlPoint::Package>.


SUPPPORT

A PerlPoint mailing list is set up to discuss usage, ideas,
bugs, suggestions and translator development. To subscribe,
please send an empty message to perlpoint-subscribe@perl.org.

If you prefer, you can contact me via perl@jochen-stenzel.de
