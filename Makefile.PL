Welcome to PerlPoint::Template::Traditional $version!

This distribution allows you to use an extended version of the
traditional pp2html template syntax in PerlPoint styles for the
new pp2tdo generator.

Users of a style based on this engine can use that style after
installation.

The installation is well prepared now, and you might run
"make test" and "make install".

EOM
